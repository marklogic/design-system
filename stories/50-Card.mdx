## Usage Guidelines
### Add New card
* Use Ant's plus-circle icon, Link color and text "Add New":

<img src="images/add_card.png" width="250"/>

### Existing card
* Use Ant's Card component:

<img src="images/existing_card.png" width="250"/>

* Footer icons are: Advanced Settings, Edit, Delete.

* Reduce card opacity to 20% and show navigational menu on mouse-over:

<img src="images/hover_card.png" width = "250"/>

## Text Guidelines
* Use Title Case for the heading.
Example:

<img src="images/example_card.png" width = "250"/>


## Functionality Not Available
### Permission Text Guidelines
When functionality is not available on a card, place text on the card to tell the user why:
* Alignment of the permission text is dependent on the other information on cards. See images for some options.
* If the functionality is not available because of permissions, the exact wording of the text should be as described in the [Hints about Permission](http://marklogic-ui-component-library.eng.marklogic.com/?path=/docs/welcome--to-storybook)  spec.
* If the functionality is not available for some other reason, state the reason.
